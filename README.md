# Run Buddy (Lesson 1)
In this lesson, we are taught the very basics of HTML/CSS, as well as some advanced CSS. A file system is also introduced on how to keep the project organized in accordance to today's best practices.

The focus of this learning included adding content, functionality, and styling to a webpage, and understanding how each file interacts with each other. 

We are also introduced to GitHub and uploading our local repositories in order to save our projects online.
